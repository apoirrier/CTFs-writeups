# Baby onion

## Description

> Ogres are like onions!

Attached is a `.onion` file.

## Solution

Let's use `file` on the given file. This is ASCII text, so let's read it. We see a huge hexadecimal string.

We decode it using Python:

```python
with open("baby.onion", "r") as f:
    s = f.read()
decoded = bytes.fromhex(s).decode()
print(decoded)
```

Now we see a huge base64 encoded string (there are two `=` at the end which look like base64 padding).

So let's decode it:

```python
import base64
decode_b64 = base64.b64decode(decoded).decode()
print(decode_b64)
```

And now we also see a lot of hexadecimal characters. So let's automate the decryption:

```python
while True:
    decoded = bytes.fromhex(decode_b64).decode()
    print(decoded)
    decode_b64 = base64.b64decode(decoded).decode()
    print(decode_b64)
```

This finally gives us the flag.
