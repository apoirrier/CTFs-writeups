We can connect to a remote server and are given this Python script:

```python
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad

        cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

## Description

We have two different options:
- generate a guest token
- login as admin using an admin token.

Guest tokens are an AES-CBC mode encryption of `access=9999;expiry={expires_at}`. A token is considered as an admin token if `access=0000` is present in its decryption. This is a very simple example of malleability of AES-CBC (for the first block).

Let's recall how AES-CBC works: it selects a random IV (Initialization Vector), then uses AES as a block cipher to encrypt data. The plaintext is split into blocks (adding padding to get a multiple of the block length), and the ciphertext is generated as follows:

```
c[i] = AES_Enc(c[i-1] XOR m[i])
```

with `c[0]` being the IV. The ciphertext is `c` (including the IV). The decryption formula is the following:

```
m[i] = AES_Dec(c[i]) XOR c[i-1]
```

and the IV is discarded. 

## Solution

If we replace `IV` by `IV XOR D`, the corresponding first block of the plaintext will be decoded as `m[0] XOR D`. We can therefore XOR our IV with the corresponding values to change 9999 into 0000. When the server will decrypt our ciphertext, it will read `access=0000`.

```python
token = '606af8cd5c376066077ce589997aa89602a98905e123243aa4591a2291e4909e71cab0734fff1e71c21fee3f5e71a480'
token = bytes.fromhex(token)

iv = token[:16]
ct = token[16:]

for i in range(7,11):
    iv = iv[:i] + bytes([(iv[i] ^ ord('0') ^ ord('9'))]) + iv[i+1:]

print(iv.hex())
print(ct.hex())
```
