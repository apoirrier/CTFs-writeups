## Steganography

- [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) to determine file type

- [binwalk](https://tools.kali.org/forensics/binwalk) to find embedded files
- [StegSolve](https://en.kali.tools/all/?tool=1762) an image solver
- [Steg online](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/#decode) for images
- [Morse decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html)
- [MMSSTV](https://hamsoft.ca/pages/mmsstv.php) for HAM transmissions
- [Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit](http://diit.sourceforge.net/) for images
- [DeepSound](http://jpinsoft.net/DeepSound/Download.aspx) for sound files
- [Raw Pixels](http://rawpixels.net/) an online RAW image viewer
- [Hexed.it](https://hexed.it/) to edit the bytes of a file

## Forensics
- [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/) for device analysis


## Cryptography

- https://www.dcode.fr/en It knows a lot of common cypher methods and does automatic uncyphering
- [hlextend](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/hlextend) a Python library for length extension attacks on Merkle-Damg√•rd hash functions
- Factorize big integers with http://factordb.com/

## Password cracking

- [JohntheRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)

## OSINT

- [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) to scrap information on social media

## Misc

- If you know the format of the flag, you can use `flag_converter.py` to quickly have the most common encoding of the flag, so you know what to look for during the competition ;)
- https://www.asciitohex.com/  For quick conversion between ASCII, decimal, base64, binary, hexadecimal and URL
- https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ Same as asciitohex but more complete, with magic wand.
- https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/ASCII-Table.svg: An Ascci to decimal, hexadecimal, binary and octal table
- Deal with images in Python using [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). See [example writeup](DarkCTF2020/Misc/QuickFix.md)
