## Solution

We decompile the binary using Ghidra, and see that it encrypts the input string and then compares it to the key encrypted with the same function. We just reverse the encryption function and give it the encrypted key found in the file.

```python
secret = b"aQLpavpKQcCVpfcg"

key = []

for i in range(len(secret)):
    for c in range(65, 122):
        if (c * 8 + 0x13) % 0x3d + 0x41 == secret[i]:
            key.append(c)
            print(key)

print("".join([chr(c) for c in key]))
```

The key is `try_to_break_meG`. This gives us the flag.
